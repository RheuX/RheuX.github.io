# Hello üëã 

## Basic Info

My name is Axel Nicholas Lorens.
I'm from Indonesia, and I went to UC Davis as a Computer Science major :D

I live at California, South San Francisco.
The timezone is in `Pacific Time` or `PT`, or it's `GMT-7`

I currently have macOs Sequoia 15.0, and I also have a Windows 11.

### Fun Fact
I have been called 4 different names on different occassion that I would like to share with you, and i'll rank them based on how often it is.
  
1. Axel (well people are nice enough)
2. Alex (i seem to get a lot of this often, not sure why, its not even swapping 2 characters side by side)
3. Excel (... I'm not from Microsoft)
4. XL (I... some just shorten my name)

Anyway, hopefully you guys would follow the trend, or create a new one :D
